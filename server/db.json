Yes, it still has all the hits — the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon —but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay.

Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the Colony pizza. Many others looked like worth competitors, but the Colony really found its way to my heart. when you start with a great crust, top it with top notch cheese and sauce, you've got a winner. But, if you go a step further and add the salty from the pepperoni, the sweet from the honey, and the spicy from the chili oil.... your mouth is confused and happy at the same time.",

Straightforward classics like smoked brisket and baby back ribs are always a strong choice, but there are also options like pork belly tacos and a lamb belly banh mi. The space is sprawling in a way that feels like the real deal, and Durney himself can usually be found working the room, and keeping a watchful eye on the smoking meats.

The potato salad was very light and tasted clean ( less mayo, lots of dill and some cucumber) -- refreshing for a humid summer night! Sandwich was surprisingly delicious - it is very small ( funny allusion to a White Castle burger) but it packs a punch!

The food is surprisingly well-executed and conceived, and our dinner service flowed smoothly without a hitch. Just make sure to get a reservation in advance, as I'm sure more than just a few other people will have the same idea.",

Beyond ramen, Mu also offers some high minded plates, like foie gras-stuffed chicken wings, as well as dry-aged Japanese Wagyu beef specials. Mu is just 10 short minutes away from Midtown via the 7-train.",

New York's only Michelin-starred Mexican restaurant is an especially cool choice for lunch during the week or drinks after work. Eater critic Ryan Sutton awarded this restaurant two stars.",

      "text": "For a Michelin star restaurant, it's fairly priced and the food is fairly good. Started with a strawberry margarita which was good in flavor but not much alcohol. Had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and it was really good. Great balance in flavor and a good portion. Extra tasty with their hot sauces. My wife had the lamb but it was a bit too salty for our taste. Although, it was cooked very well and fell off the bone. The highlight of the night was the tres leches cake. Probably the best I've ever had to be honest. Not too sweet and very milky. Overall, one of my top 3 favorite Mexican in NY.",
